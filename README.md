# Khoj: A Search Engine with Crawler Written in PHP

Khoj is a web-based search engine built using PHP, MySQL, and Ajax. It includes a web crawler that can index and retrieve information from websites, as well as a search interface that allows users to search for specific keywords.

## Features
- Web crawler that can index and retrieve information from websites
- Search interface that allows users to search for specific keywords
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Uses PHP, MySQL, and Ajax
## Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher
- Apache web server 

## Installation
Clone the repository using the following command:
 
```git clone https://github.com/Ajinkgupta/khoj.git```
Create a MySQL database for Khoj and import the db.sql file included in the repository. You can use the following commands to do so:

 
```mysql -u username -p
CREATE DATABASE khoj;
USE khoj;
source /path/to/db.sql;``` 


Configure the database credentials in the config.php file by modifying the following lines:

```
$host = "localhost";
$user = "username";
$password = "password";
$database = "khoj";```
Replace username and password with your MySQL username and password, respectively.

Upload the project files to your web server.

Open the index.php file in your web browser to use the search engine.

Great, Ajink Gupta has already created a README file for Khoj on GitHub. However, I can still provide some feedback on it if you'd like.

Overall, the README file looks good, as it provides a clear overview of the project and its features. However, there are a few areas where it could be improved:

The installation instructions could be more detailed. For example, it would be helpful to provide specific commands for creating the database and importing the khoj.sql file.

The usage instructions could be more specific as well. For instance, it would be helpful to include a screenshot or example of the search interface.

The section on credits could be expanded to include more information on the libraries used in the project.

Here's an updated version of the README file that addresses these issues:
